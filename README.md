# NegaCalc
This is my solution for the graphing calculator demo in CS193P.

## What is included?

Code solutions to assignments one through three (covered in lectures one through eight), plus much of the extra credit.


## Why is this on GitHub?

  - Reason 1: Because non-Stanford students might need help or hints, or might benefit from seeing somebody else's solution for a given problem.  Students working independetly don't have the benefit of in-person study group.
  - Reason 2: Because the version of Swift used in the Winter 2015 (early 2015) lectures is different from the version of Swift that shipped with XCode in Winter 2016 (early 2016).
  - Reason 3: At the time of writing, Stanford does not have plans to re-release the CS193P lecture for 2016.
  - Reason 4: This project uses solutions that didn't exist in 2015, when the lectures were made.  In paticular, we use StackView to layout the calculator buttons instead of raw AutoLayout.

## Good luck!

I am a student, just like you, learning the material, just like you.  You might have your own ideas on how to solve these problems, you might see flaws in my code, or you might have your own style that you want to enforce in your own project.
