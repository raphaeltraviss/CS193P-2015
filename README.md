# CS193P Winter 2015 Solutions

These are my personal solutions to the CS193P programming assignments, along with some extra-credit features.


## Why is this on GitHub?

  - Reason 1: Because non-Stanford students might need help or hints, or might benefit from seeing somebody else's solution for a given problem.  Students working independetly don't have the benefit of in-person study group.
  - Reason 2: Because the versions of Xcode and Swift used in the Winter 2015 (early 2015) lectures are different from the current versions of Xcode and Swift.
  - Reason 4: This project uses solutions that didn't exist in 2015. For example: UIStackView to layout calculator buttons.

## Good luck!

I am a student, just like you, learning the material, just like you.  You might have your own ideas on how to solve these problems, you might see flaws in my code, or you might have your own style that you want to enforce in your own project.
